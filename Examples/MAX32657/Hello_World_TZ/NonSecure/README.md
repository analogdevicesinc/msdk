## Description

A basic getting started program using Cortex-M33 TrustZone feature.

This version of Hello_World prints an incrementing count to the console UART and toggles a LED0 every 500 ms from the non-secure world. Incrementing the count is done in the Secure world.

Under the **Hello_World_TZ** example, the **Secure** and **NonSecure** projects demonstrate building the secure and non-secure code into a single image. You do not build directly in the **NonSecure** project.
