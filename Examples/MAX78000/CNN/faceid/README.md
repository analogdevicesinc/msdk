## Description

This demo generates a 512-length embedding that can be used for face recognition from face images. 
It is trained with the VGGFace-2 dataset using MTCNN and FaceNet models for embedding generation.

The code is auto-generated by the ai8x-synthesis tool and runs a known-answer
test with a pre-defined input sample. 

## Setup 

##### Building Firmware:

Before building firmware you must select the correct value for _BOARD_  in "project.mk", either "EvKit\_V1" or "FTHR\_RevA", depending on the EV kit you are using to run the example.

After doing so, navigate to the directory where the example is located using a terminal window. Enter the following comand to build all of the files needed to run the example.

```
$ make
```

##### Required Connections:

If using the Standard EV Kit (EvKit_V1):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins 1 and 2 (P0_1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

If using the Featherboard (FTHR_RevA):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
*** CNN Test ***

*** PASS ***

Time for CNN: 1882 us
```
