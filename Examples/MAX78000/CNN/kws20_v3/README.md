## Description

This demo classifies audio into one of 20 different keywords. It is trained with the 2nd version of Google's
speech commands dataset. This dataset consists of 35 keywords and more than 100K utterances.

The code is auto-generated by the ai8x-synthesis tool and runs a known-answer
test with a pre-defined input sample. This example will be enhanced with live capture and TFT
output in the near future.

## Setup
** Required Connections **
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   For the standard EV Kit (EvKit\_V1), connect pins 1 and 2 (P0\_1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

** Other **
-	Ensure variable "BOARD" is appropriately selected for the EV Kit you are using (EvKit\_V1 or FTHR\_RevA) in *project.mk*.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:
