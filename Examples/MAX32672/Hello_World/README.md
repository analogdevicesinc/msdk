## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Select RX0 and TX0 on Headers JP10 and JP11 (UART 0).
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
Hello World!
count = 0
count = 1
count = 2
count = 3
count = 4
...
```

You will also observe LED0 blinking at a rate of 1Hz.
