# BLE_led
Based on Bluetooth fitness demo, use PMIC RGB LED to indicate the BLE status. The RGB LED starts to blink blue every second. Once 
a BLE connection is established, the RGB LED stops blinking and remains blue.  

Bluetooth fitness device. Showcases heart rate, battery level, running speed and cadence.
Refer to [BLE_fit](../../../../Libraries/Cordio/docs/Applications/BLE_fit.md) documentation in the Cordio Library.

## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Required Connections

If using the Standard EV Kit board (EvKit\_V1):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR - UART) connector.
-   Close jumpers JP7 (RX_EN) and JP8 (TX_EN).
-   Close jumpers JP5 (LED1 EN) and JP6 (LED2 EN).

### Project-Specific Build Notes
* Setting `TRACE=1` in [**project.mk**](project.mk) initializes the on-board USB-to-UART adapter for
viewing the trace messages and interacting with the application. Port uses settings:
    - Baud            : 115200  
    - Char size       : 8  
    - Parity          : None  
    - Stop bits       : 1  
    - HW Flow Control : No  
    - SW Flow Control : No
