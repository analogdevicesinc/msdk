For beginners, learngitbranching.js.org is a great hands-on starting resource. Contribution Guidelines The MSDK follows the GitHub contribution guidelines . External contributions from outside the Analog Devices organization should be made via a Pull Request opened from a fork. Internal contributions should also preferrably use a fork where possible. If a direct branch on the mainline MSDK repo is made, the following branch naming conventions should be used when possible: Bugfix/ticket: fix/ticketnumber New feature: feature/branchname Generic development branch: dev/branchname New and/or modified example branch: example/branchname Style Guide The MSDK code-base, for the most-part, follows the Linux Kernel coding style and Google's C++ Style Guide with the following exception(s): Indentations are 4 spaces. Formatting and styling is enforced via clang-format version 14 and cpplint , which automatically run checks against all PRs. A PR cannot be merged until it passes these checks. Running the Linter & Formatter Both utilities can be run locally. cpplint should be run first, then clang-format. Additionally, both should be run from the root directory of the MSDK repo so that their config files are loaded properly. clang-format rules are loaded from the .clang-format and cpplint rules are loaded from CPPLINT.cfg in the root directory of the repo. As a result, the utilities must also be run from the root directory of the repo. cpplint cpplint enforces good code practices by scanning for common mistakes and ensuring certain higher-level code patterns are followed. It's a good idea to resolve the errors found by cpplint before before running clang-format, which deals with lower-level code styling and syntax patterns. cd into the root directory of the MSDK repo. Run cpplint. To run cpplint on a file , use cpplint <filepath> . $ cpplint Examples/MAX78000/Hello_World/main.c Done processing Examples/MAX78000/Hello_World/main.c To recursively run cpplint on an entire directory , use cpplint --recursive <filepath> . $ cpplint --recursive Examples/MAX78000 Examples/MAX78000/ADC/example_config.h:1: #ifndef header guard has wrong style, please use: EXAMPLES_MAX78000_ADC_EXAMPLE_CONFIG_H_ [build/header_guard] [5] Examples/MAX78000/ADC/example_config.h:14: #endif line should be \"#endif // EXAMPLES_MAX78000_ADC_EXAMPLE_CONFIG_H_\" [build/header_guard] [5] Done processing Examples/MAX78000/ADC/example_config.h Done processing Examples/MAX78000/ADC/main.c Done processing Examples/MAX78000/AES/main.c Done processing Examples/MAX78000/ARM-DSP/arm_bayes_example/arm_bayes_example_f32.c ... Resolve any errors. git add and git commit any changes to your code. clang-format clang-format is a code formatter and style checker that enforces a common style for the code-base. The MSDK uses version 14 , which is sometimes not available by default on some Linux distributions. It can be retrieved from https://apt.llvm.org/ . cd into the root directory of the MSDK repo. Run clang-format. To run a clang-format check on a file, use the -n \"dry-run\" flag. clang-format-14 --style=file --Werror --verbose -n <filename> For example: $ clang-format-14 --style=file --Werror --verbose -n Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c Formatting [1/1] Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c:86:40: error: code should be clang-formatted [-Wclang-format-violations] for (i = 0; i < DATA_LENGTH; i++) { array[i] = i; } ^ To apply the formatter to automatically format a file, use the -i flag. clang-format-14 --style=file --Werror --verbose -i <filename> For example: $ clang-format-14 --style=file --verbose -i Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c Formatting [1/1] Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c This will apply the formatter and overwrite the file.

The same checks will be automatically run against any PRs that are opened in the MSDK, and they must pass before the code can be approved. Contributing Examples First, ensure that the example project has been linted and formatted to follow the Style Guide Copy the example project into the Examples folder of the SDK for the applicable target microcontrollers. git add and git commit the Example project. Commit your project files before running MSDKGen. Run the MSDKGen utility to ensure the example project's support files are updated to the latest version. python msdkgen.py update-all --projects yourprojectname --overwrite Re-test the project if applicable. If the updated files break any projects they can be restored to the previously working version using the git restore command. For example, the command below will restore all files in your current working directory. git restore ** The git diff command can also be used to inspect local changes to help identify the root cause. Ex: git diff ./ Contributing Libraries Libraries should be added to the Libraries sub-folder of the MSDK. All libraries should include a libraryname.mk file that can be added to Libraries/libs.mk via a toggle-switch. The filename should match the name of library as closely as possible, and expose any required configuration variables . If necessary, a library may also include a \"core\" Makefile or set of Makefiles to build it as a standalone static library file. The naming convention is lib<libraryname>.a . Self-Locating Makefile The first thing that the libraryname.mk file should do is locate its own directory and store it in a variable. The code snippet can be used to achieve this. ifeq \"$(LIBRARYNAME_DIR)\" \"\" # If LIBRARYNAME_DIR is not specified, this Makefile will locate itself. LIBRARYNAME_DIR := $(dir $(abspath $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST)))) endif All filepaths for the library should then use this $(LIBRARYNAME_DIR) -type variable as their \"root\" for all filepaths. This is a safe and reliable way to self-reference internal library files. For an example, see the Libraries/PeriphDrivers/periphdriver.mk file. Simple Libraries For simple libraries, it may be sufficient to just add the library's source files to the build using VPATH and IPATH . For example: IPATH += $(LIBRARY_NAME_DIR)/include VPATH += $(LIBRARY_NAME_DIR)/src SRCS += libfile1.c SRCS += libfile2.c An example of this is MiscDrivers , which is a simple source-file-only library. It gets its source code selectively added to the build via Libraries/Boards/MAX78000/EvKit_V1/board.mk files. Advanced Libraries More advanced libraries (including those with a large number of source files) should include a rule to build as a static library file with a recursive Make call . This type of library should also set up the appropriate configuration variables to include that static library to the build. Contributing Documentation Code Maintainers MSDK code should be documented using Doxygen syntax on all public functions, data structures, and variables. See the DoxyGen Manual for more details on syntax for C-like languages. DoxyGen is automatically run across the MSDK code as part of the User Guide's build process. A Peripheral API reference is generated for each target microcontroller using the Doxygen files located in Libraries/PeriphDrivers/Documentation , and the output is packaged as a sub-component of the User Guide when it's built. For code maintainers no action is needed other than maintaining up to date Doxygen documentation for all source code. User Guide An MSDK User Guide is maintained in the USERUIDE.md file. This document contains higher-level usage info for the MSDK. If a part, IDE, or library is supported by the MSDK then there should be some relevant info in the User Guide covering its setup, configuration, and usage. When writing markdown links, relative paths should always be used. Additionally, links to local files on the user's filesystem cannot be used, since the online copy of the docs will throw a 404 on them. See Writing Your Docs for more details. Static resources such as images should be placed in the res folder. Building the Documentation Local Builds The Documentation/build.py script can be used to build the MSDK User Guide and supporting documentation locally. This script: Builds all the Peripheral API references using Doxygen and copies them into Documentation Copies any markdown (.md) files from the root of the repo into Documentation Builds the MSDK User Guide using Mkdocs , which packages everything in Documentation into a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript site in the docs folder. To build the docs: Install doxygen Install Python 3 pip install -r Documentation/requirements.txt python Documentation/build.py The site will be built in the docs folder of the repo. To preview the generated site: mkdocs serve This will open a localhost test server with live re-loading. To configure the generated site, use mkdocs.yml . See Mkdocs Configuration for more details. Auto Builds and Deployment The \"Build & Deploy Docs\" Github Action will perform all the local steps above. Additionally, it will deploy the static site to the gh-pages branch of the repository for use with Github Pages . When the gh-pages branch is updated, Pages will refresh the online copy of the documentation within ~5-10 mins. This auto-deploy procedure is triggered on every push to the release branch.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#analog-devices-msdk-development-and-contribution-guidelines","text":"","title":"Analog Devices MSDK Development and Contribution Guidelines"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#development-flow","text":"Development for the MSDK also follows the official GitHub development flow guidelines .

That includes register and system startup files to enable low-level development for its supported parts . It also provides higher-level peripheral driver APIs (written in C) alongside various utilities, third-party libraries, Board Support Packages (BSPs), and a set of example programs for each microcontroller. Additionally, the MSDK includes a GCC-based toolchain, and builds are managed by a system of Makefiles (See GNU Make ). A custom fork of OpenOCD enables flashing and debugging. The MSDK's toolchain and build system offers a Command Line Interface (CLI), and project files for supported development environments are maintained that build on top of that CLI. This document describes the MSDK's installation, setup, and usage. Supported Operating Systems Windows (Windows 10 only) Linux (Ubuntu only) MacOS Supported Parts The MSDK officially supports the following microcontrollers and evaluation platforms.

Windows 10 Linux (Ubuntu) This file must be made executable before running ( chmod +x MaximMicrosSDK_linux.run ). Alternatively, set `Allow executing as program\" in the Ubuntu GUI. MacOS On MacOS, the installer is distributed inside a .dmg disk image file. Double-click the downloaded file to mount it. Afterward, the installer executable will be made available inside the mounted drive. Setup Download the installer executable to an accessible location and launch it. Click Next to proceed from the Welcome screen. Choose the installation location. By default, the MSDK will install to the MaximSDK folder off your filesystem's root. Select the components to install. It's recommended to install all components. Continue to the installation page, and click install to begin. Installation can be safely canceled at any time. Click Finish to complete the installation. You should now see the contents of the installation directory populated with the MSDK. Note: On MacOS, some additional steps are required. Completing the Installation on MacOS On MacOS, some additional missing packages must be manually installed with Homebrew . For non-M1 platforms: Follow the instructions on the Homebrew home page to install Homebrew on your system. Then, open a terminal and run the command brew install libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb For M1 platforms : The MSDK's OpenOCD binaries ship pre-compiled for Intel Silicon (i386). As a result, you should use a Rosetta terminal on M1 platforms to install the i386 version of Homebrew and retrieve OpenOCD's dependencies with it. Installing from Rosetta ensures OpenOCD gets the packages with the architecture it needs. From there, Rosetta will handle the rest and allow running the binaries on the M1 platform's arm64 architecture. The i386 version of Homebrew can be installed in parallel with the arm64 version and typically installs into a separate filesystem. Open a terminal and update Rosetta. softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license Close the terminal. Run a new terminal in Rosetta: Go to Finder > Applications and find your Terminal Right-Click Terminal and Duplicate it. Rename it to \"Terminal i386\". Rich-Click \"Terminal i386\" > Get Info > Enable \"Open using Rosetta\" Launch the new \"Terminal i386\" and type arch to verify that it says i386 now. From your Rosetta terminal, follow the instructions on the Homebrew home page to install Homebrew on your system. Verify the correct version of Homebrew is running from your Rosetta terminal using the which brew command. This command should return a path beginning with /usr/local . Note: On systems with multiple or pre-existing Homebrew installations, the arm64 version of Homebrew may still take precedence over the newly installed x86_64 version. If which brew contains /opt/homebrew instead, you may need to edit your terminal profile's startup script. Alternatively, you can directly run the correct Homebrew binary using its absolute path. Run the command brew install libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb (or, if you need to use the absolute path) /usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew install libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb Maintenance An MSDK installation contains a MaintenanceTool executable program in the root directory. Use the Maintenance Tool to retrieve updates, manage components, and uninstall the MSDK. Updates The MSDK releases updates quarterly, and the Maintenance Tool will retrieve the latest release when Update components is run. Older Versions and Offline Installer Older versions of the MSDK are available as an offline installer for each release tag. They are available on the Releases page of the MSDK GitHub and can be used to roll back to a specific MSDK release. Development Resources Users can obtain development copies of the MSDK resources from Github . Setup instructions can be found in the repository's README . Getting Started The MSDK is designed for both evaluation and end-application development. The typical evaluation cycle usually involves setting up the development environment, running demos, and exercising the peripheral driver API on an evaluation platform . The typical development cycle typically involves building a prototype application on an evaluation platform first, then porting the application to a custom board. This section describes how to get started with the MSDK focusing on the evaluation cycle. First , review the Key Concepts below. Then, proceed to the section for your preferred IDE. Each sub-section is written as a self-contained quick-start with links to additional documentation on important topics. Getting Started with Visual Studio Code Getting Started with Eclipse Getting Started with Command-Line Development Key Concepts The MSDK supports multiple development environments with different features that may tailor to the user's preferences. There are a few key concepts to remember that are universal to MSDK development. Target Microcontroller : The target microcontroller refers to the base part number of the microcontroller used for development. The MSDK contains register-level support and startup files for each of its supported parts , and it's important to note that support files for a target microcontroller and its Board Support Packages are distinct from each other. For example, if the MAX78000EVKIT or MAX78000FTHR is being used, the Target Microcontroller is the MAX78000. Board Support Package (BSP) : The MSDK supports evaluation platforms for target microcontrollers with Board Support Packages . For microcontrollers with multiple evaluation platforms, multiple BSPs are available. These can be found in the Libraries/Boards folder of the MSDK installation. By default, most projects in the MSDK come pre-configured for the \"EVKIT\"-type BSP, which is generally the largest evaluation platform for that device with most (or all) pins broken out. It's important to note that the active BSP may need to be reconfigured for a project, which is done slightly differently for each development environment. System Environment : Your system's environment is a broad term that encapsulates the programs and variables available to your system's shell on the command line. The user is expected to have some basic familiarity with this concept. System Path : Your system's Path is a unique environment variable that tells it where to search for program binaries. The user is expected to be familiar with this concept and how to modify the system Path if necessary. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) : An IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) that manages the tools for editing source code, building source code, flashing program binaries, and debugging . The abbreviation is frequently used in this document, and the MSDK supports multiple IDEs that can be used depending on preference. (See \"Supported Development Environments\" ) Build Configuration vs. Project Configuration : An MSDK project is comprised of two complementary systems: The Build System and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) . These systems each offer their own configuration interfaces, and it's important to note what each is used for. The Build System manages source code compilation into program binaries and offers a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for setting Build Configuration Variables . The IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) for managing a project and sits on top of the build system's CLI . Each IDE offers its own settings for managing fundamental aspects of the build, such as: Setting the Target Microcontroller Setting the Board Support Package Configuring the Environment and System Path for use with the MSDK toolchain Getting Started with Visual Studio Code The MSDK includes Visual Studio Code (\"VS Code\") support through the VSCode-Maxim project. This section walks through setup, opening, and running an example project with VS Code. This material is also available in video form targeting the MAX78000 in \"Understanding Artificial Intelligence Episode 8.5 - Visual Studio Code\" . For complete documentation, see the Visual Studio Code section of this User Guide. Setup (VS Code) The setup below only needs to be done once per MSDK installation . Download and install Visual Studio Code for your OS here . Launch Visual Studio Code. Install the Microsoft C/C++ extension . Use CTRL + SHIFT + P (or COMMAND + SHIFT + P on MacOS) to open the developer prompt. Type \"open user settings\" and select the \"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)\" option. Add the entries below to your user settings.json file. // There may be other settings up here... \"MAXIM_PATH\": \"C:/MaximSDK\", // Set this to the installed location of the MaximSDK. Only use forward slashes '/' when setting this path! \"update.mode\": \"manual\", \"extensions.autoUpdate\": false, // There may be other settings down here... Save your changes to the file with CTRL + S and restart VS Code. Building and Running a Project (VS Code) Launch Visual Studio Code. Select File -> Open Folder... Navigate to an example project for the target microcontroller in the MSDK's Examples folder and open it with Select Folder . VS Code will prompt for trust the first time. Select Trust folder and enable all features The opened project should look something like this. Set the Board Support Package to match your evaluation platform. In VS Code, this is done by editing the .vscode/settings.json file and setting the \"board\" project configuration option. See Board Support Packages for more details. Save your changes to settings.json with CTRL+S . Reload the VS Code window. After changing any options in settings.json , a reload is necessary to force it to re-index VS Code's Intellisense engine. VS Code can be conveniently reloaded with the Reload Window developer command accessed with CTRL + SHIFT + P (or COMMAND + SHIFT + P on MacOS). Press the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B to open the available Build Tasks (alternatively navigate to Terminal -> Run Build task... ). Run the \"build\" task to compile the project for the configured Target Microcontroller and BSP . Notice that the TARGET and BOARD Build Configuration Variables are set on the command line. The program binary is successfully compiled into the .elf program binary in the build sub-folder of the project. Connect a debug adapter between the host PC and the evaluation platform. Detailed instructions on this hardware setup can be found in the evaluation platform's Datasheet and Quick-Start Guide, which are available on its analog.com product page. Run the flash build task. Running this task will automatically build the project if needed, flash the program binary, and halt the program execution to await a debugger connection. Open the Run and Debug window ( CTRL+SHIFT+D ) and launch the debugger ( F5 ). Verify the program counter enters main successfully. Press Continue ( F5 ) to run the program. Continue | Step Over | Step Into | Step Out | Restart | Stop Exercise the debugger and press stop to disconnect when finished. Getting Started with Eclipse Setup (Eclipse) The only setup required to use Eclipse is to ensure that the \"Eclipse\" component has been selected during the MSDK installation . If the MSDK is already installed, Eclipse can be retrieved using the Maintenance Tool . This section is an Eclipse \"quick-start\" that walks through creating, building, and running a project. For complete documentation, see the Eclipse section of this User Guide. Building and Running a Project (Eclipse) Launch Eclipse with its start menu shortcut. Ensure Eclipse is set to the C/C++ perspective in the top right corner. Otherwise, the new project wizard will not show up. Navigate to File -> New -> Maxim Microcontrollers . Enter the project name and hit Next . Follow the new project wizard. Chip type selects the Target Microcontroller Board type selects the Board Support Package (BSP) Example type selects the example project to be copied as the template for the new project. Adapter type selects the debug adapter to use. Select Finish to create the new project. Build the project using the Build hammer button (top left). Select the correct project in the Launch Configuration dropdown and set it to Debug mode. Use the Debug button (top left) to flash the program binary and connect the debugger. The Eclipse view will switch to debug mode, and the debugger will break on entry into main . Resume the program ( F8 ) using the top control bar and exercise the debugger. Terminate the debugger ( CTRL+F2 ) when finished. Getting Started with Command-Line Development This section demonstrates how to build MSDK example projects on the command line. It also shows how to flash and debug over the command line. The MAX78002EVKIT will be used as an example, but the same concepts apply to all parts. For more detailed documentation, see the Command-Line Development section of this User Guide. Setup (Command-Line) Windows On Windows, use the MinGW shortcut to launch an MSYS2/MinGW terminal. This shortcut points to Tools/MSYS2/msys.bat in an MSDK installation and correctly configures the user's environment for development. Linux/MacOS On Linux and MacOS, copy the following contents into your shell's terminal profile/startup script to manually configure your environment for MSDK development. Depending on your system and shell, this could be ~/.profile , ~/.zprofile , ~/.bashrc , ~/.zshrc , etc. Command-line Linux/MacOS users are expected to know which file to edit for their particular system and preferences. # Set MAXIM_PATH to point to the MSDK export MAXIM_PATH=#changeme! # Add Arm Embedded GCC to path (v10.3) export ARM_GCC_ROOT=$MAXIM_PATH/Tools/GNUTools/10.3 export PATH=$ARM_GCC_ROOT/bin:$PATH # Add xPack RISC-V GCC to path (v10.2) export XPACK_GCC_ROOT=$MAXIM_PATH/Tools/xPack/riscv-none-embed-gcc/10.2.0-1.2 export PATH=$XPACK_GCC_ROOT/bin:$PATH # Add OpenOCD to path export OPENOCD_ROOT=$MAXIM_PATH/Tools/OpenOCD export PATH=$OPENOCD_ROOT:$PATH Change export MAXIM_PATH=#changeme! to the installation location of the MSDK. This will make the toolchain accessible from the command line by adding it to your system's path . # Set MAXIM_PATH environment variable export MAXIM_PATH=$HOME/MaximSDK Verification Run the following commands to verify that the toolchain is accessible. They should display version numbers successfully. arm-none-eabi-gcc -v arm-none-eabi-gdb -v make -v openocd -v Any \"file not found\" errors indicate that MAXIM_PATH has not been set correctly or the system's Path has not been configured correctly. Building and Running an Example (Command-Line) First, copy an example project to an accessible directory outside of the SDK. It is strongly recommended to keep the MSDK examples unmodified in case they need to be referenced again later. Launch your terminal. On Windows, use the MinGW shortcut or Tools/MSYS2/msys.bat file to launch the MSYS2 terminal. cd into the location of the copied example project. Run the following command to build the example: make -r -j -r is an option that improves build speed. -j enables parallel execution of the build in the maximum number of threads.

IDEs This section offers detailed usage info on the MSDK's supported Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), focusing on the typical development cycle. It expands on the info presented in \"Getting Started\" with more detailed usage info. Visual Studio Code Support for Visual Studio Code is maintained for the MSDK and developed on the VSCode-Maxim GitHub repository. For setup/quick-start instructions, see \"Getting Started with Visual Studio Code\" first. Opening Example Projects Visual Studio Code is built around a \"working directory\" paradigm. The editor is always rooted in a working directory, and the main mechanism for changing that directory is File -> Open Folder... As a result, you'll notice that there is no \"New Project\" mechanism. A \"project\" in VS Code is simply a folder. It will look inside the opened folder for a .vscode sub -folder to load project-specific settings from. (Note: You may need to enable viewing of hidden items in your file explorer to see the .vscode sub-folder). To open a project: 1. Launch Visual Studio Code. Select File -> Open Folder... Navigate to an example project for the target microcontroller in the MSDK's Examples folder and open it with Select Folder . VS Code will prompt for trust the first time. Select Trust folder and enable all features The opened project should look something like this. Verify the Board Support Package for the project is set correctly. See How to Set the BSP (VS Code) below. How to Set the BSP (VS Code) To set the BSP for an open project: Set the \"board\" project configuration option in .vscode/settings.json , which maps to the BOARD Build Configuration Variable . See Board Support Packages for a table of possible values. Reload the VS Code window to re-index its Intellisense engine. VS Code can be conveniently reloaded with the Reload Window developer command accessed with CTRL + SHIFT + P (or COMMAND + SHIFT + P on MacOS). Building a Project An open project will present four available build tasks from Terminal > Run Build task... or the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B . Run the \"build\" task to compile the project for the configured Target Microcontroller and BSP . Notice the TARGET , BOARD , and PROJECT Build Configuration Variables being set on the command line, and the program binary successfully compiled into the .elf program binary in the build sub-folder of the project. Cleaning a Project To clean a project, run the clean build task . This will delete the build folder and its contents. The next time the project is built, it will be rebuilt from scratch. It should be noted that clean will only remove the project's build output. The clean-periph task can be used to clean the project and the peripheral driver libraries. Flashing and Debugging This section assumes a debugger is connected between the host PC and the evaluation platform. For more detailed instructions on this hardware setup, refer to the evaluation platform's Datasheet and Quick-Start Guide, which are available on its analog.com product page. Arm Core Debugging Run the flash build task . Running this task will automatically build the project if needed, flash the program binary, and halt the program execution to await a debugger connection. Flashing does not happen automatically when launching the debugger . This is an intentional design choice for VS Code to allow the debugger to quickly restart the program under debug without a lengthy re-flash procedure. Open the Run and Debug window ( CTRL+SHIFT+D ) and launch the debugger ( F5 ). Use the Arm M4 profile. Verify the program counter enters main successfully. Press Continue ( F5 ) to run the program. The debugger control bar can be used to exercise the debugger further. Continue | Step Over | Step Into | Step Out | Restart | Stop Breakpoints Breakpoints can be set by clicking next to a line number in VS Code's editor. They are removed by clicking on them again. Additionally conditional breakpoints can be added by right-clicking on a line. The condition and condition type can be modified with the dropdown. This is useful for setting a breakpoint on a certain value in a for loop iterator or when a specific bit in a register is set, for example. Peripheral Browsing A peripheral browser lets you quickly view the formatted register-level contents of the peripheral blocks on a target microcontroller under debug. Currently, VSCode-Maxim does not feature a true peripheral browser. Instead, watch expressions can be used to inspect peripherals at the register level. Watch expressions can be set for all registers. (For example, the sysctrl register below). Adding ,b lets you print out the value in binary Adding ,x prints the value in hex . Standard logical and bitwise operations are supported inside the watch expression. Register and variable values can be modified through these same watch-points. (Right click -> Set Value) It should be noted that the debugger's watch points are contextual , meaning that its symbol look-ups will depend on the active point in your program. Dual Core Debugging For microcontrollers with both an Arm M4 and a RISC-V core, the GDB (RISC-V) launch profile is provided to enable RISC-V debugging. The RISC-V core requires setup and handoff from the Arm M4 core. As a result, this is an advanced configuration requiring a unique combination of the project's source code, Makefiles, and VSCode-Maxim project settings. Such projects are appended with the -riscv suffix in the project's folder name. This section demonstrates how to debug -riscv projects in VS Code using the mnist-riscv project for the MAX78000 as an example. Connect both your Arm (SWD) and RISC-V (JTAG) debuggers. VSCode-Maxim projects come pre-configured to use the ARM-USB-OCD-H + ARM-JTAG-20-10 adapters for the RISC-V JTAG port. Ex: Make sure your Olimex debugger drivers are installed correctly. Sometimes they need to be updated using the \"zadig\" tool. See Section 3.3.3 of the Olimex User Manual , and use the Zadig tool to install WinUSB drivers. Download the max78000_riscv.cfg file and place it inside the Tools/OpenOCD/scripts/target folder of your MSDKinstallation. Open the project in VS Code. Run the \"Flash\" task. Launch the debugger using the GDB (Arm M4) profile first : ... which should hit the breakpoint in main.c ... Continue the debugger. The code in main.c will boot up the RISC-V core. You can optionally set a breakpoint on WakeISR to see when the RISC-V core has signaled it's ready. Now, switch the debugger profile to the GDB (RISC-V) profile and launch it. This will launch an additional instance on a separate port and connect to the Olimex adapter. The \"Signal 0\" exception below is a known issue caused by a reset bug on the RISC-V core. The exception message is harmless and can be safely ignored. From here, the debugger should be fully functional. The Arm vs. RISC-V debugger instance can be selected with the dropdown on the debugger control bar. Eclipse Running Eclipse Eclipse must be launched with the Eclipse MaximSDK shortcut. The shortcut points to the Tools/Eclipse/cdt/eclipse(.bat/.sh) file, which configures Eclipse's system environment for use with the MSDK toolchain. When Eclipse is launched, it will prompt for a workspace location. This is a local folder that Eclipse will copy its projects into. Creating a New Project Launch Eclipse. Ensure that the Eclipse is set to the C/C++ perspective in the top right corner. Otherwise, the new project wizard will not show up. Navigate to File -> New -> Maxim Microcontrollers . Enter the project name and hit Next . Follow the new project wizard. Chip type selects the Target Microcontroller Board type selects the Board Support Package (BSP) Example type selects the example project to be copied as the template for the new project. Adapter type selects the debug adapter to use. Select Finish to create the new project. Importing Examples Launch Eclipse. Use File -> Import to open the import wizard. Select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace and hit Next . Browse to the Examples folder in the MSDK installation for your target microcontroller and select the example projects to import into the workspace. Ensure that Copy projects into workspace is selected. This will copy the projects out of the MSDK and leave the originals unmodified. Select Finish to import the project(s). The projects should now show up in the Project Explorer. How to Set the BSP (Eclipse) Imported Eclipse projects files are configured for the EVKIT -type BSP by default. To set the BSP: Open (right click) the project properties and navigate to C/C++ Build -> Environment . Set the BOARD Build Configuration Variable to match the target evaluation platform. See Board Support Packages for a table of possible values. clean and rebuild the project. Building a Project Ensure that the Eclipse is set to the C/C++ perspective (top right). Select the correct project in the Launch Configuration dropdown. Use the Build hammer button (top left) to build the project. Flashing and Debugging Connect a debug adapter between the host PC and the evaluation platform. For more detailed instructions on this hardware setup, refer to the evaluation platform's Datasheet and Quick-Start Guide, which are available on its analog.com product page. Ensure the correct project in the Launch Configuration dropdown is selected in Debug mode. Use the Debug button (top left) to flash the program binary and connect the debugger. The Eclipse view will switch to debug mode, and the debugger will break on entry into the main. Resume the program ( F8 ) using the top control bar and exercise the debugger. Terminate the debugger ( CTRL+F2 ) when finished. Command-Line Development This section offers more detailed info on command-line development. For setup/quick-start, see \"Getting Started with Command-Line Development\" How to Set the BSP (Command-Line) To persistently the BSP, set the BOARD Build Configuration Variable . by editing the project.mk that can be found inside each project. # This file can be used to set build configuration # variables. These variables are defined in a file called # \"Makefile\" that is located next to this one. # For instructions on how to use this system, see # https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/ # ********************************************************** # Add your config here! BOARD=FTHR_RevA # Set the BSP for the MAX78000FTHR Alternatively, set BOARD on the command line when building (i.e., make -r -j BOARD=FTHR_RevA ) to set/override the BSP for a single build. Building on the Command-Line cd into the project folder. Run make Parallel Build (fastest build, but console message formatting may be mangled): make -r -j Serial Build make -r Take note of the output filename and location, which by default is the lowercase name of the Target microcontroller and created in the build folder. Cleaning on the Command-Line cd into the project folder. Run make clean Project clean : make clean deletes the project build folder and all of its contents. Library clean : make distclean can be used to clean out all build products, including the project build folder and all peripheral driver libraries. Flashing on the Command-Line Build the project. Connect a debug adapter between the host PC and the evaluation platform. For more detailed instructions on this hardware setup, refer to the evaluation platform's Datasheet and Quick-Start Guide, which are available on its analog.com product page. Flash the program using openocd . Flash and exit: Use this command if you just want to flash the program but not debug . OpenOCD will flash the program and exit on completion. openocd -s $MAXIM_PATH/Tools/OpenOCD/scripts -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/max78002.cfg -c \"program build/max78002.elf verify exit\" -f target/max78002.cfg sets the OpenOCD config file for the Target microcontroller .

For microcontrollers with multiple evaluation platforms, multiple BSPs will be available. The role of a BSP is to provide a hardware abstraction layer for the initialization and management of board-level hardware such as serial interfaces, pushbuttons, LEDs, external peripheral devices, TFT displays, etc. which will vary between evaluation platforms. The BSP abstraction layer also improves code portability to custom devices. The first task when opening or creating any project is to ensure the BSP is set correctly. How to Set the BSP To set the BSP for a project: In VS Code : How to Set the BSP (VS Code) In Eclipse : How to Set the BSP (Eclipse) Command-Line Development: How to Set the BSP (Command-Line) BSP Table Available BSPs are located in the Libraries/Boards folder for each Target Microcontroller . The name of a BSP's folder is used with the BOARD build configuration variable to build a project for a specific BSP. The table below matches the correct BOARD values to external part numbers .

Inspecting the Libraries/CMSIS/Device/Maxim/TARGET/Source/system_TARGET.c for a target microcontroller shows how the BSP is integrated and which startup functions can be implemented. For example, the MAX78000's system_max78000.c startup file shows that PreInit and Board_Init are weak functions that can be overridden. They are called from the default SystemInit implementation, which can also be overridden. /* This function is called before C runtime initialization and can be * implemented by the application for early initializations. If a value other * than '0' is returned, the C runtime initialization will be skipped. * * You may over-ride this function in your program by defining a custom * PreInit(), but care should be taken to reproduce the initialization steps * or a non-functional system may result. */ __weak int PreInit(void) { /* Do nothing */ return 0; } /* This function can be implemented by the application to initialize the board */ __weak int Board_Init(void) { /* Do nothing */ return 0; } /* This function is called just before control is transferred to main(). * * You may over-ride this function in your program by defining a custom * SystemInit(), but care should be taken to reproduce the initialization * steps or a non-functional system may result. */ __weak void SystemInit(void) { /* Configure the interrupt controller to use the application vector table in */ /* the application space */ #if defined(__CC_ARM) || defined(__GNUC__) /* IAR sets the VTOR pointer incorrectly and causes stack corruption */ SCB->VTOR = (uint32_t)__isr_vector; #endif /* __CC_ARM || __GNUC__ */ /* Enable instruction cache */ MXC_ICC_Enable(MXC_ICC0); /* Enable FPU on Cortex-M4, which occupies coprocessor slots 10 and 11 */ /* Grant full access, per \"Table B3-24 CPACR bit assignments\". */ /* DDI0403D \"ARMv7-M Architecture Reference Manual\" */ SCB->CPACR |= SCB_CPACR_CP10_Msk | SCB_CPACR_CP11_Msk; __DSB(); __ISB(); SystemCoreClockUpdate(); Board_Init(); } A custom BSP can implement one or all of the weak functions. To do so, it's recommended to create a new directory inside the Libraries/Boards folder for the target microcontroller with the file structure below. The name of the created directory will be the string to use with the BOARD build configuration variable to select the custom BSP. Libraries \u2514\u2500 Boards \u2514\u2500 TARGET \u2514\u2500 CustomBSP \u251c\u2500 Include | \u2514\u2500 board.h \u251c\u2500 Source | \u2514\u2500 board.c \u2514\u2500 board.mk The following contents can be used as a bare-bones starter template. board.h // board.h #define BOARD_CUSTOM // ^ This type of compiler definition is // sometimes useful. It allows application code // to check if a specific BSP is being used. // Ex: #ifdef BOARD_CUSTOM // ... // #endif /** * \\brief Initialize the BSP and board interfaces. * \\returns #E_NO_ERROR if everything is successful */ int Board_Init(void); board.c //board.c #include \"board.h\" #include \"mxc_error.h\" int Board_Init(void) { // Implement me! return E_NO_ERROR; } board.mk ifeq \"$(BOARD_DIR)\" \"\" # This Makefile will self-locate if BOARD_DIR is not specified. BOARD_DIR := $(dir $(abspath $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST)))) endif SRCS += board.c VPATH += $(BOARD_DIR)/Source IPATH += $(BOARD_DIR)/Include Disabling BSPs It should also be noted that BSP integration can be disabled entirely by setting the LIB_BOARD build configuration variable to 0. This will skip the inclusion of the BSP's board.mk file entirely, and the default system initialization functions will be used. Build System Build System Overview The Build System manages the compilation of source code into program binaries and offers a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for setting Build Configuration Variables . All IDEs interface with this system. The Build System is managed by two files found in a project's root directory, one called Makefile and one called project.mk . These files are used by the GNU Make program (which is a part of the MSDK toolchain) to locate and build a project's source code. Makefile is the \"core\" file and should not be edited directly. Instead, it exposes the CLI that can be accessed in the project.mk file, on the command line, in your system's environment, or through your IDE. It also comes with a default configuration that is suitable for most projects. project.mk offers a convenient and stable access point for advanced build configuration, and this is the file that should be edited if necessary. When the command make is run from inside of a project folder, the program make will resolve any project-specific settings and then build the project's source code. Default Build Behavior By default, the build system will auto-search the root project directory for source code ( *.c ) and header files ( *.h ) to compile into a program binary. The optional include and src directories are also searched if they exist. Root Project Directory \u251c\u2500 project.mk \u251c\u2500 Makefile \u251c\u2500 *.h \u251c\u2500 *.c \u251c\u2500include # <-- Optional \u2514\u2500 *.h \u251c\u2500src # <-- Optional \u2514\u2500 *.c Additionally, a project's build system will come pre-configured for a specific Target Microcontroller and its primary BSP . The default configuration is suitable for most use cases, but a system of Build Configuration Variables is available if additional configuration is needed. Build Configuration Variables A Build Configuration Variable is a Makefile variable and therefore follows the same rules. However, they have been streamlined to be made much easier to use, so most of the official GNU Make documentation is only needed for advanced use cases. How to Set a Build Configuration Variable To set a standard configuration variable, use the = syntax ... VARIABLE=VALUE The = operator is used for most configuration variables with a few exceptions (documented in the reference table ) when a variable should contain a list of values . In such cases, use += the syntax to add values to the list. VARIABLE+=VALUE1 VARIABLE+=VALUE2 Where to Set a Build Configuration Variable For most variables, you should set them in the project.mk file (exceptions are documented in the reference table and IDE-specific sections). For example, to enable hardware floating-point acceleration for a project, the MFLOAT_ABI configuration variable can be used with a value of hard . The contents of project.mk might then look as follows: ( Inside project.mk ) # This file can be used to set build configuration # variables. These variables are defined in a file called # \"Makefile\" that is located next to this one. # For instructions on how to use this system, see # https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/ # ********************************************************** MFLOAT_ABI=hard # Enable hardware floating point acceleration It should also be noted that configuration variables can be set on the command line as well. For example make MFLOAT_ABI=hard will have the same effect. Additionally, environment variables can be used. For example (on Linux) export MFLOAT_ABI=hard will set the hardware floating point acceleration as the default for all projects with an environment variable. However, there is a precedence hierarchy that should be taken into consideration. Precedence Hierarchy The precedence hierarchy for the value of a configuration variable is: IDE/command-line > project.mk > environment variable > default value If a value is set in an IDE and project.mk, the IDE's value will take precedence. However, the \"override\" directive can be used in project.mk to give it max precedence. Build Configuration Variables Reference Table Configuration Variable Description Details TARGET Set the Target Microcontroller If you are using an IDE, set this variable in the IDE's settings instead of project.mk BOARD Set the Board Support Package (BSP) If you are using an IDE, set this variable in the IDE's settings instead of project.mk. See Board Support Packages for more details. When you change this option, it's usually a good idea to fully clean your project, then rebuild. MAXIM_PATH (Optional) Specify the location of the MSDK This optional variable can be used to change where the Makefile looks for the MSDK installation. By default, the build system will attempt to locate the MSDK with a relative path. If a project is moved outside of the SDK, this variable must be set to the absolute path of the MSDK installation. CAMERA (Optional) Set the Camera drivers to use This option is only useful for the MAX78000 and MAX78002 and sets the camera drivers to use for the project. Permitted values are HM01B0 , HM0360_MONO , HM0360_COLOR , OV5642 , OV7692 (default), or PAG7920 . Camera drivers can be found in the Libraries/MiscDrivers/Camera folder. Depending on the selected camera, a compiler definition may be added to the build. See the board.mk file for the active BSP for more details. VPATH Where to search for source (.c) files Use the += operator with this variable . This controls where the Makefile will look for source code files. If AUTOSEARCH is enabled (which it is by default), all source code files in the directories specified by this option will be automatically added to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is disabled, this tells the Makefile where to look for the files specified by SRCS . IPATH Where to search for header (.h) files Use the += operator with this variable . This controls where the Makefile will look for header files. Unlike the VPATH option, this is not related to AUTOSEARCH . Individual header files are not ever manually added to the build. Instead, you only need to specify the location of your header files. AUTOSEARCH Automatically search for source (.c) files Enable or disable the automatic detection of .c files on VPATH (enabled by default). Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. If auto-search is disabled, source files must be manually added to SRCS . SRCS List of source (.c) files to add to the build Use the += operator with this variable . All of the files in this list will be added to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is enabled, this is most useful for adding the full absolute path to a singular source file to selectively add to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is disabled, all of the source files for the project must be added to SRCS , and they must also all be located on an entry in VPATH . Otherwise, a full path relative to the Makefile must be used. PROJECT Set the output filename This controls the output filename of the build. File extensions should not be included in the filename. For VS Code, you should use the project_name advanced config option instead of project.mk. MXC_OPTIMIZE_CFLAGS Set the optimization level See Optimize Options for more details. Normal builds will default to -Og , which is good for debugging, while release builds will default to -O2 . PROJ_CFLAGS Add a compiler flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Compiler flags can be added with this option, including compiler definitions. For each value, the same syntax should be used as if the compiler flag was passed in over the command line. These can include standard GCC options and/or ARM-specific options. PROJ_AFLAGS Add an assembler flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Assembler flags can be added with this option. MFLOAT_ABI Set the floating point acceleration level Sets the floating-point acceleration level. Permitted values are hard , soft , and softfp (default). To enable full hardware acceleration instructions, use hard , but keep in mind that all libraries your source code uses must also be compiled with hard . If there is any conflict, you'll get a linker error. For more details, see -mfloat-abi under ARM Options . LINKERFILE Set the linkerfile to use Set the linkerfile with this option. The file should exist in Libraries/CMSIS/Device/Maxim/TARGET/Source/GCC in the MSDK, or it should be placed inside the root directory of the project. PROJ_LDFLAGS Add a linker flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Flags can be passed to the linker with this option. See GCC Options for Linking LIB_BOARD Include the BSP library (enabled by default) Inclusion of the Board-Support Package (BSP) library, which is enabled by default, can be toggled with this variable. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_PERIPHDRIVERS Include the peripheral driver library (enabled by default) The peripheral driver library can be toggled with this option. If disabled, you'll lose access to the higher-level driver functions but still have access to the register-level files. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_CMSIS_DSP Include the CMSIS-DSP library The CMSIS-DSP library can be enabled with this option. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_CORDIO Include the Cordio library The Cordio BLE library can be included with this option. This is only applicable for microcontrollers with an integrated BLE controller. LIB_FCL Include the Free Cryptographic Library (FCL) This option toggles the Free Cryptographic Library (FCL), which is a collection of software-implemented common cryptographic functions that can be included with this option. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_FREERTOS Include the FreeRTOS library The FreeRTOS library can be enabled with this option, which is an open-source Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_LC3 Include the LC3 codec library This option enables the inclusion of the Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3), which is an efficient low latency audio codec. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_LITTLEFS Include the littleFS library This option toggles the \"Little File System\" library - a small filesystem library designed for microcontrollers. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_LWIP Include the lwIP library LIB_MAXUSB Include the MaxUSB library This option toggles the inclusion of the MAXUSB library, which facilitates the use of the native USB peripherals on some microcontrollers. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_SDHC Include the SDHC library This option toggles the Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) library, which can be used to interface with SD cards. Additionally, it enables the FatFS library, which implements a generic FAT filesystem. SBT Toggle SBT integration Toggles integration with the Secure Boot Tools (SBTs) . These are a suite of applications designed for use with microcontrollers that have secure bootloaders. When this is enabled, some additional rules become available such as make sla and make scpa . Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. MAXIM_SBT_DIR Where to find the SBTs This option can be used to manually specify the location of the SBTs. Usually, this is not necessary. By default, the Tools/SBT directory of the MaximSDK will be searched. If the SBT installer is used, it will set the MAXIM_SBT_DIR environment variable to point to itself automatically. TARGET_SEC Secure part number to use Some secure microcontrollers have multiple secure variants, and this option can be used to specify the variant to use with the SBTs. Defaults are intelligently selected and can be found in $(MAXIM_SBT_DIR)/SBT-config.mk SCP_PACKETS Where to build the scp_packets folder Defaults to build/scp_packets TEST_KEY Which test key to sign applications with Defaults to $(MAXIM_SBT_DIR)/devices/$(TARGET_SEC)/keys/maximtestcrk.key , which is the Maxim test key that can be used for development. Peripheral Driver API A microcontroller is made up of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) that is surrounded by additional peripheral hardware blocks such as timers, memory controllers, UART controllers, ADCs, RTCs, audio interfaces, and many more. The Peripheral Driver API is an important core library in the MSDK that allows the CPU to utilize the microcontroller's hardware blocks over a higher-level Application Programming Interface (API) . The links below will open detailed API references for each microcontroller. Offline copies of these API references can also be found in the Documentation folder of the MSDK installation . MAX32520 API MAX32650 API MAX32655 API MAX32660 API MAX32665-MAX32666 API MAX32670 API MAX32672 API MAX32675 API MAX32680 API MAX32690 API MAX78000 API MAX78002 API Organization The Peripheral Driver API's source code is organized as follows: Header files (.h) can be found in the Libraries/PeriphDrivers/Include folder. These files contain function declarations for the API, describing the function prototypes and their associated documentation. Source files (.c) can be found in the Libraries/PeriphDrivers/Source folder. These files contain the function definitions for the API - the implementations of the functions declared by the header files. The implementation files are further organized based on die type and hardware revision . This is worth noting when browsing or debugging through the drivers. The die type files follow the _MEXX or _AIXX naming convention These files' responsibility is to manage microcontroller-specific implementation details that may interact with other peripheral APIs before ultimately calling the revision-specific files. The _hardware revision_ files follow the _revX naming convention. These files contain the pure driver implementation for a peripheral block and typically interact with the hardware almost entirely at the register level. Examples The MSDK contains examples for each microcontroller that demonstrate the usage of its Peripheral APIs . They can be found in the Examples folder of an MSDK installation. Each example contains a README.md file describing what it does. In general, there is at least one example per peripheral block, and the example's name will indicate what it matches (i.e., DMA , ADC , SPI ). Libraries The MSDK contains a large number of libraries, both third-party and in-house. These libraries are an extension to the \"core\" SDK resources and contain drivers for various external components such as TFT displays, cameras, accelerometers, audio codecs, and other devices. The MSDK also contains libraries for more advanced internal hardware peripherals that provide an additional abstraction layer over the Peripheral Driver API , such as USB, the SDHC interface, and the Cordio BLE stack. Libraries are enabled for a project with a convenient toggle switch (See the \"Libraries\" section of the Build Configuration Variables ). When a library is enabled, it may also offer its own Build Configuration Variables in addition to those already available in the core Build System . CMSIS-DSP The CMSIS-DSP library provides a suite of common Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functions that take advantage of hardware accelerated Floating Point Unit (FPU) available on microcontrollers with Arm Cortex-M cores. This library is distributed in the MSDK as a pre-compiled static library file, and the MSDK maintains a port of the official code examples in the ARM-DSP Examples folder for each microcontroller. Please refer to the CMSIS-DSP official documentation for more detailed documentation on the library functions and usage. CMSIS-DSP Supported Parts All microcontrollers with a Cortex M4 core are supported. Cordio Bluetooth Low Energy The Cordio Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) library provides a full BLE stack for microcontrollers with an integrated BLE controller. The Cordio library warrants its own separate documentation. See the Cordio BLE User Guide . Cordio Supported Parts MAX32655 MAX32665 MAX32680 MAX32690 MAXUSB The MAXUSB library provides a higher-level interface for utilizing the built-in USB controller hardware available on some microcontrollers. This allows the microcontroller to enumerate as a USB device without the need for an external USB controller IC. MAXUSB Supported Parts MAX32570 MAX32650 MAX32655 and MAX32656 MAX32665-MAX32666 MAX32690 MAX78002 Miscellaneous Drivers The Libraries/MiscDrivers folder of the MSDK contains drivers for miscellaneous external components such as TFT displays, cameras, audio codecs, PMICs, pushbuttons, etc. These resources are usually closely tied with the Board Support Packages .

The MSDK's toolchain and build system offers a Command Line Interface (CLI), and project files for supported development environments are maintained that build on top of that CLI.

For non-M1 platforms: Follow the instructions on the Homebrew home page to install Homebrew on your system. Then, open a terminal and run the command brew install libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb For M1 platforms : The MSDK's OpenOCD binaries ship pre-compiled for Intel Silicon (i386). As a result, you should use a Rosetta terminal on M1 platforms to install the i386 version of Homebrew and retrieve OpenOCD's dependencies with it. Installing from Rosetta ensures OpenOCD gets the packages with the architecture it needs. From there, Rosetta will handle the rest and allow running the binaries on the M1 platform's arm64 architecture. The i386 version of Homebrew can be installed in parallel with the arm64 version and typically installs into a separate filesystem. Open a terminal and update Rosetta. softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license Close the terminal.

Note: On systems with multiple or pre-existing Homebrew installations, the arm64 version of Homebrew may still take precedence over the newly installed x86_64 version. If which brew contains /opt/homebrew instead, you may need to edit your terminal profile's startup script. Alternatively, you can directly run the correct Homebrew binary using its absolute path.

The typical evaluation cycle usually involves setting up the development environment, running demos, and exercising the peripheral driver API on an evaluation platform . The typical development cycle typically involves building a prototype application on an evaluation platform first, then porting the application to a custom board. This section describes how to get started with the MSDK focusing on the evaluation cycle. First , review the Key Concepts below. Then, proceed to the section for your preferred IDE. Each sub-section is written as a self-contained quick-start with links to additional documentation on important topics. Getting Started with Visual Studio Code Getting Started with Eclipse Getting Started with Command-Line Development","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"USERGUIDE/#key-concepts","text":"The MSDK supports multiple development environments with different features that may tailor to the user's preferences. There are a few key concepts to remember that are universal to MSDK development. Target Microcontroller : The target microcontroller refers to the base part number of the microcontroller used for development. The MSDK contains register-level support and startup files for each of its supported parts , and it's important to note that support files for a target microcontroller and its Board Support Packages are distinct from each other. For example, if the MAX78000EVKIT or MAX78000FTHR is being used, the Target Microcontroller is the MAX78000. Board Support Package (BSP) : The MSDK supports evaluation platforms for target microcontrollers with Board Support Packages . For microcontrollers with multiple evaluation platforms, multiple BSPs are available. These can be found in the Libraries/Boards folder of the MSDK installation. By default, most projects in the MSDK come pre-configured for the \"EVKIT\"-type BSP, which is generally the largest evaluation platform for that device with most (or all) pins broken out. It's important to note that the active BSP may need to be reconfigured for a project, which is done slightly differently for each development environment. System Environment : Your system's environment is a broad term that encapsulates the programs and variables available to your system's shell on the command line. The user is expected to have some basic familiarity with this concept. System Path : Your system's Path is a unique environment variable that tells it where to search for program binaries. The user is expected to be familiar with this concept and how to modify the system Path if necessary. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) : An IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) that manages the tools for editing source code, building source code, flashing program binaries, and debugging . The abbreviation is frequently used in this document, and the MSDK supports multiple IDEs that can be used depending on preference. (See \"Supported Development Environments\" ) Build Configuration vs. Project Configuration : An MSDK project is comprised of two complementary systems: The Build System and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) . These systems each offer their own configuration interfaces, and it's important to note what each is used for. The Build System manages source code compilation into program binaries and offers a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for setting Build Configuration Variables . The IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) for managing a project and sits on top of the build system's CLI . Each IDE offers its own settings for managing fundamental aspects of the build, such as: Setting the Target Microcontroller Setting the Board Support Package Configuring the Environment and System Path for use with the MSDK toolchain","title":"Key Concepts"},{"location":"USERGUIDE/#getting-started-with-visual-studio-code","text":"The MSDK includes Visual Studio Code (\"VS Code\") support through the VSCode-Maxim project.

VSCode-Maxim projects come pre-configured to use the ARM-USB-OCD-H + ARM-JTAG-20-10 adapters for the RISC-V JTAG port. Ex: Make sure your Olimex debugger drivers are installed correctly. Sometimes they need to be updated using the \"zadig\" tool. See Section 3.3.3 of the Olimex User Manual , and use the Zadig tool to install WinUSB drivers. Download the max78000_riscv.cfg file and place it inside the Tools/OpenOCD/scripts/target folder of your MSDKinstallation. Open the project in VS Code. Run the \"Flash\" task. Launch the debugger using the GDB (Arm M4) profile first : ... which should hit the breakpoint in main.c ... Continue the debugger. The code in main.c will boot up the RISC-V core. You can optionally set a breakpoint on WakeISR to see when the RISC-V core has signaled it's ready. Now, switch the debugger profile to the GDB (RISC-V) profile and launch it. This will launch an additional instance on a separate port and connect to the Olimex adapter. The \"Signal 0\" exception below is a known issue caused by a reset bug on the RISC-V core. The exception message is harmless and can be safely ignored. From here, the debugger should be fully functional. The Arm vs. RISC-V debugger instance can be selected with the dropdown on the debugger control bar.","title":"Dual Core Debugging"},{"location":"USERGUIDE/#eclipse","text":"","title":"Eclipse"},{"location":"USERGUIDE/#running-eclipse","text":"Eclipse must be launched with the Eclipse MaximSDK shortcut.

See Board Support Packages for more details. When you change this option, it's usually a good idea to fully clean your project, then rebuild. MAXIM_PATH (Optional) Specify the location of the MSDK This optional variable can be used to change where the Makefile looks for the MSDK installation. By default, the build system will attempt to locate the MSDK with a relative path. If a project is moved outside of the SDK, this variable must be set to the absolute path of the MSDK installation. CAMERA (Optional) Set the Camera drivers to use This option is only useful for the MAX78000 and MAX78002 and sets the camera drivers to use for the project. Permitted values are HM01B0 , HM0360_MONO , HM0360_COLOR , OV5642 , OV7692 (default), or PAG7920 . Camera drivers can be found in the Libraries/MiscDrivers/Camera folder. Depending on the selected camera, a compiler definition may be added to the build. See the board.mk file for the active BSP for more details. VPATH Where to search for source (.c) files Use the += operator with this variable . This controls where the Makefile will look for source code files. If AUTOSEARCH is enabled (which it is by default), all source code files in the directories specified by this option will be automatically added to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is disabled, this tells the Makefile where to look for the files specified by SRCS . IPATH Where to search for header (.h) files Use the += operator with this variable . This controls where the Makefile will look for header files. Unlike the VPATH option, this is not related to AUTOSEARCH . Individual header files are not ever manually added to the build. Instead, you only need to specify the location of your header files. AUTOSEARCH Automatically search for source (.c) files Enable or disable the automatic detection of .c files on VPATH (enabled by default). Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. If auto-search is disabled, source files must be manually added to SRCS . SRCS List of source (.c) files to add to the build Use the += operator with this variable . All of the files in this list will be added to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is enabled, this is most useful for adding the full absolute path to a singular source file to selectively add to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is disabled, all of the source files for the project must be added to SRCS , and they must also all be located on an entry in VPATH . Otherwise, a full path relative to the Makefile must be used. PROJECT Set the output filename This controls the output filename of the build. File extensions should not be included in the filename. For VS Code, you should use the project_name advanced config option instead of project.mk. MXC_OPTIMIZE_CFLAGS Set the optimization level See Optimize Options for more details. Normal builds will default to -Og , which is good for debugging, while release builds will default to -O2 . PROJ_CFLAGS Add a compiler flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Compiler flags can be added with this option, including compiler definitions. For each value, the same syntax should be used as if the compiler flag was passed in over the command line. These can include standard GCC options and/or ARM-specific options. PROJ_AFLAGS Add an assembler flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Assembler flags can be added with this option. MFLOAT_ABI Set the floating point acceleration level Sets the floating-point acceleration level. Permitted values are hard , soft , and softfp (default). To enable full hardware acceleration instructions, use hard , but keep in mind that all libraries your source code uses must also be compiled with hard . If there is any conflict, you'll get a linker error. For more details, see -mfloat-abi under ARM Options . LINKERFILE Set the linkerfile to use Set the linkerfile with this option. The file should exist in Libraries/CMSIS/Device/Maxim/TARGET/Source/GCC in the MSDK, or it should be placed inside the root directory of the project. PROJ_LDFLAGS Add a linker flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Flags can be passed to the linker with this option. See GCC Options for Linking LIB_BOARD Include the BSP library (enabled by default) Inclusion of the Board-Support Package (BSP) library, which is enabled by default, can be toggled with this variable. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_PERIPHDRIVERS Include the peripheral driver library (enabled by default) The peripheral driver library can be toggled with this option.

LIB_CMSIS_DSP Include the CMSIS-DSP library The CMSIS-DSP library can be enabled with this option. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_CORDIO Include the Cordio library The Cordio BLE library can be included with this option. This is only applicable for microcontrollers with an integrated BLE controller. LIB_FCL Include the Free Cryptographic Library (FCL) This option toggles the Free Cryptographic Library (FCL), which is a collection of software-implemented common cryptographic functions that can be included with this option.

For the latest core specification, refer to the documentation page. This will be your best resource for learning the details of Bluetooth Low Energy. These books are also excellent references for developers. Getting Started with Bluetooth Low Energy by O'Reilly Bluetooth Low Energy: The Developer's Handbook by Robin Heydon Architecture The Bluetooth stack closely resembles the layers of the network stack. We have the application layer at the top and the physical layer at the bottom. Each layer encapsulates the data and passes it to the appropriate section of the upper and lower layers. The Host Controller Interface (HCI) is the common point where devices are split. Typically this interface is over an asynchronous protocol such as UART. Some devices will define proprietary interfaces between the application and host layers. Multi-core SOCs can also use the HCI or proprietary interfaces to split the stack between multiple CPUs. Test equipment will have a USB interface and act as a Host device when testing the Controller layers. Devices under test will use a USB to UART adapter and act as Controller devices. States These are the common states used in Bluetooth LE communication. Typically devices will be in only one of these states at a time, but it is possible for devices to be in all simultaneously. Advertising Devices in this state are broadcasting advertisement packets to scanning/initiating devices. This is an asynchronous operation that has no synchronization with peer devices. Advertising devices transmit without any previous knowledge of peer devices. Advertising and scanning operations are done on channels 37, 38, and 39. The interval between advertising events is configurable between 20 ms and 10.24 s. Scanning / Initiating Devices in the scanning state listen for advertising devices and can send scan optionally requests for additional information. The scanning interval and window settings are configurable. If a device is scanning with the intent of connecting to a specific device, that is called the initiating state. The initiating devices will send a connection indication to the desired advertising device to indicate its desire to create a connection. Connected Once an initiating device sends the connection request and the advertising device accepts the connection request, the two devices enter the connected state. This is a point-to-point connection allowing devices to exchange information directly. In order to minimize interference, devices in the connected state will hop between channels 0-36 in a pseudo-random order. The channel hopping information is communicated in the connection indication. Each connection event is separated by the connection interval. This interval is configurable from 7.5 ms to 4 s. The master will always transmit first and receive second. The Slave will always receive first and transmit second. Devices will typically always send and receive at least one packet in each interval, and they can optionally transmit and receive multiple packets in each interval. Cordio Stack Architecture This document describes the Cordio software architecture. Refer to the Bluetooth specification Volume 1, Part A for additional information regarding the Bluetooth architecture. Application The App Framework performs many operations common to Bluetooth LE embedded applications, such as: Application-level device, connection, and security management. Simple user interface abstractions for button press handling, sounds, display, and other user feedback. An abstracted device database for storing bonding data and other device parameters. Profiles and Services The GATT Profile specifies the structure in which profile data is exchanged. This structure defines basic elements, such as services and characteristics, used in a profile. The top level of the hierarchy is a profile. A profile is composed of one or more services necessary to fulfill a use case. A service is composed of characteristics or references to other services. Each characteristic contains a value and may contain optional information about the value. The service and characteristic and the components of the characteristic (i.e., value and descriptors) contain the profile data and are all stored in Attributes on the server. Wireless Stack Framework The Wireless Software Foundation (WSF) is a simple OS wrapper, porting layer, and general-purpose software service used by the software system. The goal of WSF is to stay small and lean, supporting only the basic services required by the stack. It consists of the following: Event handler service with event and message passing. Timer service. Queue and buffer management service. Portable data types. Critical sections and task locking. Trace and assert diagnostic services. Security interfaces for encryption and random number generation. Platform Adaption Layer The Platform Adaption Layer is the abstraction between the software stack and the hardware. It includes APIs for timers, UART, RTC, and various system-level functions such as sleep and memory management. Attribute Protocol The ATT subsystem implements the attribute protocol and generic attribute profile (GATT). It contains two independent subsystems: The attribute protocol client (ATTC) and the attribute protocol server (ATTS). ATTC implements all attribute protocol client features and is designed to meet the client requirements of the generic attribute profile. ATTC can support multiple simultaneous connections to different servers. ATTS implements all attribute protocol server features and has support for multiple simultaneous client connections. ATTS also implements the server features defined by the generic attribute profile. Device Manager The DM subsystem implements device management procedures required by the stack. These procedures are partitioned by procedure category and device role (master or slave). The following procedures are implemented in DM: Advertising and device visibility: Enable/disable advertising, set advertising parameters and data, and set connectivity and discoverability. Scanning and device discovery: Start/stop scanning, set scan parameters, advertising reports, and name discovery. Connection management: Create/accept/remove connections, set/update connection parameters, and read RSSI. Security management: Bonding, storage of security parameters, authentication, encryption, authorization, random address management. Local device management: Initialization and reset, set local parameters, vendor-specific commands. DM procedures support the Generic Access Profile (GAP) when applicable. Security Manager Protocol The Security Manager Protocol (SMP) is the peer-to-peer protocol used to generate encryption keys and identity keys. The protocol operates over a dedicated fixed L2CAP channel. The SMP block also manages the storage of the encryption keys and identity keys and is responsible for generating random addresses and resolving random addresses to known device identities. The SMP block interfaces directly with the Controller to provide stored keys used for encryption and authentication during the encryption or pairing procedures. The SMP subsystem implements the security manager protocol. It contains two independent subsystems: The initiator (SMPI). SMPI implements the initiator features of the security manager protocol and has support for multiple simultaneous connections. The responder (SMPR). SMPR implements the responder features of the security manager protocol and has support for only one connection (by Bluetooth specification design). SMP also implements the cryptographic toolbox, which uses AES. The interface to AES is asynchronous and abstracted through WSF. SMP also implements functions to support data signing. Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol The L2CAP (Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol) resource manager block is responsible for managing the ordering of submission of PDU fragments to the baseband and some relative scheduling between channels to ensure that L2CAP channels with QoS commitments are not denied access to the physical channel due to Controller resource exhaustion. This is required because the architectural model does not assume that a Controller has limitless buffering or that the HCI is a pipe of infinite bandwidth. L2CAP Resource Managers may also carry out traffic conformance policing to ensure that applications are submitting L2CAP SDUs within the bounds of their negotiated QoS settings. The general Bluetooth data transport model assumes well-behaved applications and does not define how an implementation is expected to deal with this problem. Host Controller Interface The HCI subsystem implements the host-controller interface specification. This specification defines commands, events, and data packets sent between a Bluetooth LE protocol stack on a host and a link layer on a controller. The HCI API is optimized to be a thin interface layer for a single-chip system. It is configurable for either a single-chip system or a traditional system with wired HCI. This reconfigurability is accomplished through a layered implementation. A core layer can be configured for either a single-chip system or wired HCI. A transport and driver layer below the core layer can be configured for different wired transports such as UART. Link Layer The link layer is responsible for the creation, modification, and release of logical links (and, if required, their associated logical transports), as well as the update of parameters related to physical links between devices. The link layer achieves this by communicating with the link layer in remote Bluetooth devices using the Link Layer Protocol (LL) in LE. The LL protocol allows the creation of new logical links and logical transports between devices when required, as well as the general control of link and transport attributes such as the enabling of encryption on the logical transport and the adapting of transmit power on the physical link. Physical Layer The PHY block is responsible for transmitting and receiving packets of information on the physical channel. A control path between the baseband and the PHY block allows the baseband block to control the timing and frequency carrier of the PHY block. The PHY block transforms a stream of data to and from the physical channel and the baseband into required formats. ADI Attach ADI Attach is a smartphone application that can be used for Bluetooth debugging and development. Scan for advertising peripherals. Connect to devices and discover profiles and services. Read and write characteristics. Subscribe to notifications. Perform over-the-air firmware updates with supporting devices. BLE-PyDex BLE-PyDex is a hardware-agnostic Bluetooth device explorer designed to aid in the development and debugging of Bluetooth applications. https://github.com/EdwinFairchild/BLE-PyDex Frequently asked questions How do I change the advertising parameters? Peripheral applications will have a static structure that contains all of the advertising parameters. If run-time changes are desired, you must call AppAdvStop() before changing the parameters and AppAdvStart() to resume. With this configuration, the device will advertise at a fast interval (300 * 0.625 = 187.5 ms) for 5 seconds. It will then advertise slowly (1600 * 0.625 = 1000 ms) indefinitely. /*! configurable parameters for advertising */ static const appAdvCfg_t datsAdvCfg = { { 5000, 0}, /*! Advertising durations in ms, 0 is infinite */ { 300, 1600} /*! Advertising intervals in 0.625 ms units */ }; How do I change the connection parameters? Only the master of the connection can change the connection parameters. Peripheral devices can request a change, but only the master can accept and set the connection parameters. Cell phones and mobile operating systems have different restrictions on connection parameters. Peripheral applications have the following structure that is used to request connection parameter updates. /* iOS connection parameter update requirements The connection parameter request may be rejected if it does not meet the following guidelines: * Peripheral Latency of up to 30 connection intervals. * Supervision Timeout from 2 seconds to 6 seconds. * Interval Min of at least 15 ms. * Interval Min is a multiple of 15 ms. * One of the following: * Interval Max at least 15 ms greater than Interval Min. * Interval Max and Interval Min both set to 15 ms. * Interval Max * (Peripheral Latency + 1) of 2 seconds or less. * Supervision Timeout greater than Interval Max * (Peripheral Latency + 1) * 3. */ /*! configurable parameters for connection parameter update */ static const appUpdateCfg_t datsUpdateCfg = { 0, /*! ^ Connection idle period in ms before attempting connection parameter update. set to zero to disable */ (15 * 8 / 1.25), /*! Minimum connection interval in 1.25ms units */ (15 * 12 / 1.25), /*! Maximum connection interval in 1.25ms units */ 0, /*! Connection latency */ 600, /*! Supervision timeout in 10ms units */ 5 /*! Number of update attempts before giving up */ }; The DmConnUpdate() function can also be used to request a connection parameter update from the peripheral or initiate one from the master. /*************************************************************************************************/ /*! * \\brief Update the connection parameters of an open connection * * \\param connId Connection identifier. * \\param pConnSpec Connection specification. * * \\return None. */ /*************************************************************************************************/ void DmConnUpdate(dmConnId_t connId, hciConnSpec_t *pConnSpec); How do I use the low-power modes? All of the applications will enter sleep mode in idle when built with DEBUG=0 . The Wireless Stack Framework (WSF) operating system will call PalSysSleep() mode when idle. With DEBUG=1 , the CPU will stay in active mode to leave the debugger enabled. To enter the lowest power states, refer to the BLE_FreeRTOS application. This will create FreeRTOS tasks for the Cordio stack and allow users to add additional tasks. Enable configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE , and the device will enter standby mode and deep sleep between events. WARNING: The CPU debugger is disabled in sleep modes. If your application enters sleep mode directly after reset, it will be difficult to debug and reprogram. How do I send unformatted data like a UART? Unfortunately, there is no Bluetooth SIG-defined standard for this protocol. This stack has a proprietary data transfer service that is used to transmit unformatted data between devices. Refer to the BLE_dats (BLE Data Server) for the peripheral application. You can connect to this device with the BLE_datc (BLE data client) application to see simple data transmission. Refer to the BLE_dats and BLE_dats README for more information.

The protocol operates over a dedicated fixed L2CAP channel. The SMP block also manages the storage of the encryption keys and identity keys and is responsible for generating random addresses and resolving random addresses to known device identities. The SMP block interfaces directly with the Controller to provide stored keys used for encryption and authentication during the encryption or pairing procedures. The SMP subsystem implements the security manager protocol. It contains two independent subsystems: The initiator (SMPI). SMPI implements the initiator features of the security manager protocol and has support for multiple simultaneous connections. The responder (SMPR). SMPR implements the responder features of the security manager protocol and has support for only one connection (by Bluetooth specification design). SMP also implements the cryptographic toolbox, which uses AES. The interface to AES is asynchronous and abstracted through WSF. SMP also implements functions to support data signing.","title":"Security Manager Protocol"},{"location":"Libraries/Cordio/docs/CORDIO_USERGUIDE/#logical-link-control-adaptation-protocol","text":"The L2CAP (Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol) resource manager block is responsible for managing the ordering of submission of PDU fragments to the baseband and some relative scheduling between channels to ensure that L2CAP channels with QoS commitments are not denied access to the physical channel due to Controller resource exhaustion. This is required because the architectural model does not assume that a Controller has limitless buffering or that the HCI is a pipe of infinite bandwidth. L2CAP Resource Managers may also carry out traffic conformance policing to ensure that applications are submitting L2CAP SDUs within the bounds of their negotiated QoS settings.

These examples demonstrate a simple data client and server. The intent here is to show simple unformatted data exchange between two devices. The Bluetooth specification does not define a simple data exchange protocol, similar to UART. We use a proprietary GATT service to offer this feature. The data server will advertise with a devices name of \"DATS\". The data client will scan for this device and create a connection. Once the conneciton has been created and the client completes the discovery, it will enable notificaitons and indiciations on the proprietary data serivce. This will allow the server to transmit data to the client with notifications to the proprietary data characteristic. The client can transmit data to the server by writing to the proprietary data characteristic. ADI Attach connected to DATS ARM Proprietary data service UUID: E0262760-08C2-11E1-9073-0E8AC72E1001 This is a proprietary serivce is used for simple unformatted data exchange between the server and the client. Secure data service UUID: 42FC367E-32D9-4285-87C6-339924D135BE This is another proprietary service used for secure data exchange that requires elevated levels of encryption and authentication. Devices must be paired with LE Secure Connections to enable data transfer with this service. LEDs The red LED will indicate that an error assertion has occurred. The green LED indicates CPU activity. When the LED is on, the CPU is active, when the LED is off, the CPU is in sleep mode. BLE_Dats Bluetooth data server that advertises as \"DATS\" and accepts connection requests. This exmaples contains two proprietary services that are used to show simple message passing to and from the data client.

The Wireless Data Exchange profile is used to transfer files from the client to the server's internal/external flash. A CRC32 value is used to check the integrity of the transferred file. Usage LEDs The red LED will indicate that an error assertion has occurred. The green LED indicates CPU activity. When the LED is on, the CPU is active, when the LED is off, the CPU is in sleep mode. Setup The Bootloader application needs to be loaded prior to loading BLE_otas application. BLE_otas will run on top of the Bootloader . The linker file included with BLE_otas application must be used to properly setup the memory sections to coincide with the Bootloader . The project.mk in this BLE_otas application in conjunction with project.mk in Bootloader determine where the expected file is stored and read from. Default configuration is to use external flash to store the transferd file before writing it to internal flash space during the update. Alternatively by changing USE_INTERNAL_FLASH ?=0 to USE_INTERNAL_FLASH ?=1 the transfered file is stored in the update space.
