  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
  
# allow a single workflow to run at any given time given that these tests 
# require the use of hardware devices
# second instance of a workflow will wait on the frist to finish
# third instance cancels the second instance and waits on the first to finish
